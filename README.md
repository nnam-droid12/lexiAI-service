## LexiAI Service - Intelligent Document Processing with Azure AI
### LexiAI is a powerful AI-driven service that automates document processing, translation, and text-to-speech conversion using Azure AI Services. It enhances efficiency by extracting insights from documents, translating text, and converting it into speech for accessibility.

 ### Features
-  Upload and store documents securely using Azure Blob Storage
- Extract text from documents with Azure Document Intelligence
- Translate extracted text into multiple languages via Azure Translator
- Convert translated text to speech with Azure Speech Services
- Scalable and efficient, leveraging Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL
